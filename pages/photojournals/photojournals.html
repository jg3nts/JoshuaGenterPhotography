        <h3>Hokan-ji Temple</h3>
        <p>
          The construction of this pagoda was said to have been inspired by a
          dream of the Imperial Prince Shotoku in the year 589.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kyoto City, Japan is home to the historic Hokan-ji Temple also known
          as Yosaka-no-to (Yasaka Pagoda). This temple attracts many tourists
          throughout the year ranging from school groups to wedding parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i><u>Fun fact:</u></i> if you look closely at the corners of the
          temples' roof, each story is connected by a wire. this is to ground
          the structure as a form of lightning protection.

        <h3>Sea Caves</h3>
        <p>
          Sea caves, also known as a <i>littoral cave</i>, is a type of cave
          which is primarily formed by the eroding forces of waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sea caves are among the smallest of cave types. Factors which
          contribute to the formation of these caves including the nature of the
          zone, i.e tidal/swell conditions and the specific type of host rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i><u>Fun fact:</u></i> Overtime, the ceiling of sea cave chambers may
          erode so much that they collapse forming a large littoral sinkhole.
